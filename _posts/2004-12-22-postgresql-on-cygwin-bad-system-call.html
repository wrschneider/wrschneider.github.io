I was getting this "Bad system call" message from PostgreSQL 7.4.x on cygwin.  It was working earlier, and I thought I had done everything right--cygserver was up and running, so I didn't know what was up.   ipcs gave the same error.
<br />
<br />Turns out I had forgot the magic word: "CYGWIN=server".  The first time I installed PostgreSQL (and read the docs), I had just set the var on the command line (CYGWIN=server pg_ctl start ...)  and never put it in my profile.  Easy enough to fix.
