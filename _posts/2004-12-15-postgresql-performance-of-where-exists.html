Today I was looking into the performance of a PostgreSQL query with a "... where exists (select 1 from ...)" subquery:
<br /><pre>select foo_id from foo
<br />where exists (select 1 from bar where bar.foo_id = foo.foo_id)
<br /></pre>I was surprised to find out that this query actually ran <i>faster</i> when I restructured it with a SELECT DISTINCT and a JOIN:
<br /><pre>select distinct(foo_id) from bar
<br />join foo on bar.foo_id=foo.foo_id
<br /></pre>Some references on the web I've found suggest that EXISTS is the <a href="http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/1438631">preferred way to write the above query in general</a>. Because it's a boolean condition, in theory the database needs to scroll fewer rows because it can stop as soon as the first match is found; and the DISTINCT can be expensive if the results from the join version would not have been unique.
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br /></span>An <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-general/2001-02/msg00667.php">ancient PostgreSQL mailing list post</a> indicates that rewriting the query as a JOIN may be faster than EXISTS in PostgreSQL, because the join can take advantage of indexes while EXISTS does a nested loop. But, then again, I'm still using PostgreSQL 7.3.x, and EXISTS handling may well have been improved in 7.4.
