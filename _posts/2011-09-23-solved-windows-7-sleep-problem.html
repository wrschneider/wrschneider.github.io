Sleep mode was grayed out on new Dell laptop (Latitude E6420) on Windows 7.<br /><br />The fix was to disable the legacy VGA driver, which came up with a yellow warning icon in Device Manager ("device cannot start"). <br /><br />Simply installing the latest Intel Graphics drivers did not fix the issue - the legacy VGA driver had to be explicitly disabled.
