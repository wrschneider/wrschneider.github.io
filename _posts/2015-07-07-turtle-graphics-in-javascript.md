I found [this project](https://github.com/bjpop/js-turtle) online to do turtle graphics in Javascript, just like we used to do with Logo in grade school.
I made some patches to it and submitted as a pull request.  You can play with it live [here](https://rawgit.com/bjpop/js-turtle/master/turtle.html) 
or [here](https://rawgit.com/wrschneider/js-turtle/master/turtle.html).
