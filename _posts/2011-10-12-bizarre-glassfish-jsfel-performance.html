I found a performance issue with JSF on Glassfish 3.1.1 (and prior) in an unexpected place: a seemingly innocuous line of code like<br /><br />&lt;h:outputText rendered="#{request.requestURL.indexOf('page') ne -1}" .... /&gt;<br /><br />It turns out that invoking methods through EL expressions (new in EL 2.2) triggers creating a new ExpressionFactory, which in turn calls findResource/getResourceAsStream - a file I/O operation. <br /><br />These expressions in the "rendered" attribute are particularly bad because they get executed multiple times in various parts of the JSF lifecycle. <br /><br />See:<br /><a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES-2223">http://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES-2223</a><br /><a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/UEL-19">http://java.net/jira/browse/UEL-19</a><br /><br />On the plus side - jvisualvm totally rocks. &nbsp;I am shocked by how easy it was to get started with for tracking down these issues and it was right there in $JAVA_HOME/bin all along.
