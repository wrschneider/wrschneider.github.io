I just noticed that some browsers, like IE9 and Chrome, don't preserve insertion order of keys when iterating with a for-in loop ["for (key in array)"].  Although technically Javascript never guaranteed preserving order in a for-in loop, so many popular browsers did anyway that I was taken by surprise.<br /><br />The Chrome behavior is especially odd - it preserves order of insertion for non-numeric keys, but iterates numeric keys in numeric order first.  It also coerces numeric strings to numbers.<br /><br />This code example illustrates<br /><br /><pre class="brush:js">var foo=new Object();
<br />
<br />foo["111_"] = 1;
<br />foo["222_"] = 2;
<br />foo["333_"] = 3;
<br />foo["444"] = 4;
<br />foo["555"] = 5;
<br />foo["666"] = 6;
<br />
<br />var str = "";
<br />for (var key in foo) { 
<br />  str = str + foo[key] + " ";
<br />}
<br />document.write(str);
<br /></pre><br />In Chrome this prints "4 5 6 1 2 3".  In IE 7, IE 8, and Firefox, it prints "1 2 3 4 5 6".<br /><br />This behavior (particularly the coercion of numeric strings) has been tracked as a bug in Chrome - but unclear whether it will ever be fixed<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37404">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37404</a><br /><br />ECMAScript spec says "order of enumerating... is not defined"<br /><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf</a><br /><br />
