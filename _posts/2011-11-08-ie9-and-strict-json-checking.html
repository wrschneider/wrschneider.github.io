Got an error from IE9 complaining about "invalid character".  Turned out this was because the JSON response string had control characters (newlines) in it.  These need to be escaped.<br /><br />Other browsers will let you get away with it, but IE9 is particularly strict and jQuery doesn't check the JSON response string before handing it off to JSON.parse.<br /><br />&nbsp;Similar issue found here:  <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2010-June/011420.html">https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2010-June/011420.html</a>
