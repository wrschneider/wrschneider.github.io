I was getting mysterious, intermittent proxy errors using Apache mod_proxy to talk to an older version of Glassfish (2.x).  It turned out the root cause was size of HTTP headers as cookies were accumulating, which caused the underlying app server to close the socket without a response.<br /><br />A similar phenomenon was documented here:<br /><a href="http://kenai.com/jira/browse/KENAI-2727">http://kenai.com/jira/browse/KENAI-2727</a><br /><br />The fix was trivial: increase the "receive-buffer-in-bytes" setting in domain.xml to 8192 bytes.<br /><br />Finding it was a pain, because the older version of Glassfish had a bug such that the underlying IOException that aborted the request never got logged anywhere!<br /><a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-5181">http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-5181</a>
