The last time I re-read&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead, </i>I felt like many of the ideas in the book could be useful for software developers. &nbsp;It seemed like there are many parallels between the values demonstrated by the book's hero, Howard Roark, and good development practices. <br /><br />Many of the ideas dovetail nicely with some Agile development principles, especially the various "keep it simple" ones like&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>&nbsp;(along with DRY's cousins,"once and only once", and&nbsp;<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThreeStrikesAndYouRefactor">"three strikes and refactor"</a>). &nbsp;Roark's designs are driven entirely by purpose, function and constraints, with an open disdain for non-functional or ornamental additions. &nbsp;For example, about the house he builds for Austen Heller, Roark says:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“Every piece of it is there because the house needs it – and for no other reason… You can see each&nbsp;stress, each support that meets it... But you’ve seen buildings with columns that support nothing, with&nbsp;purposeless cornices, with pilasters, moldings, false arches, false windows… Your house is made by its&nbsp;own needs. The others are made by the need to impress. The determining motive of your house is in&nbsp;the house. The determining motive of others is the audience.”</blockquote><br />Keeping things simple and focused is hard work, just as agile development and YAGNI is not an excuse for sloppiness. &nbsp;If done correctly, it should be quite the opposite. &nbsp;In Roark's designs,&nbsp;“Not a line seemed superfluous, not a needed plane was missing. The structures were austere and&nbsp;simple, until one looked at them and realized <i>what work, what complexity of method, what tension of&nbsp;thought had achieved the simplicity.</i>” [emphasis added]<br /><br />This made me think of the quote in Uncle Bob's&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Clean_code.html?id=dwSfGQAACAAJ">Clean Code</a>: "Learning to write clean code is hard work... You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail."<br /><br />There were some other ideas I'm hoping to examine in more depth:<br />- right tool for the job - using technology idiomatically vs. legacy patterns with new technology<br />- the architect as a hands-on practitioner (vs. ivory tower)<br />- leveraging innovations - new methods, technologies etc.<br />-&nbsp;professional satisfaction / motivation<br />- interactions with business stakeholders, "people skills" and organizational politics<br />- making best of bad situations - looking for best possible solution even if you don't agree with the business problem to be solved
