Got this error when trying to upgrade from WebSphere Portal 6.0 to 7.0.<br /><br />com.ibm.portal.puma.SchemaViolationException: EJPSG0053E: Puma requested entity type Group from VMM but received Entity.<br /><br />This sets a record for one of the most unhelpful errors ever.  It can be caused by a bad entry in LDAP - in my particular case, it was a few groups whose objectClasses (groupOfUniqueNames and top) had somehow been saved with base-64 encoding instead of as plain text, although the values themselves when decoded were correct.  The same exact LDAP directory was also working fine with WebSphere 6.0.<br /><br />One of IBM's pages implies that the configuration itself is broken - when in my case, the configuration was perfectly fine and the problem was a bad entry in LDAP.  The error gives no help tracking down the broken entry.<br /><br />https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21419580<br /><br />Other IBM resources imply that the specific configuration issue is making sure that the group and user LDAP object classes are unique - i.e., don't use "top".  In my case, I was doing pretty standard stuff - groupOfUniqueNames and inetOrgPerson.<br /><br />http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpzosdoc/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.msg.doc/messages/com.ibm.wps.puma.resources.Messages.html<br /><br />https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK80507
